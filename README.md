# Calculate-Value-at-Risk
The data file is the portfolio information, which consists of 40 futures and 20 options. We have the historical prices of the futures and today's price of both futures and options. I used three ways to calculate the one day VaR of the portfolio. Which are historical methods, Monto Carlo Method with GBM and Monto Carlo with VG.
